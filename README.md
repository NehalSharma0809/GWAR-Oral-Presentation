# Crafting an Engaging User Experience for an In-Car Voice Assistant: A Design Thinking Approach

## Abstract
Voice interfaces have become increasingly common and are extensively used in smartphone assistants(like Siri and Cortana), and home devices(like Amazon Echo and
Google Home). Considering the rapid advancements in the automobile industry and the popularity of conversational assistants, the presence of an in-car voice assistant can play a pivotal role in shaping consumer behaviour, enhancing brand recognition, and improving driving experience in cars.The driver’s eyes and hands are occupied while driving, therefore, digital interactions like navigating directions and receiving calls, can be best accomplished by voice.Recognizing these use cases makes the concept of an in-car voice assistant a new domain which can be explored to deliver richer and safer driving experiences.

Distracted driving is a prominent reason of car accidents, which accounts for 25% of all car crash fatalities.Therefore, in this paper, I have reviewed a prototype for an in-car conversational assistant that reduces visual, manual and cognitive distractions of the driver, thereby, enabling a safer driving experience. The agent is capable of responding to digital devices, providing visual display of information, improving the driver’s emotional state of mind and providing navigational assistance.Effective UX tools like competitive analysis, storyboarding, journey maps, and user interviews were used to understand user expectations and create the persona of the assistant and its high-fidelity prototype accordingly.

Another important goal of this user experience research was to acknowledge the requirements, psychology and motivations of the user through observations and
feedback.Therefore, I evaluated the design decisions of the conversational assistant, through intensive user testing and heuristic evaluation results, to assess how well their speech capabilities align with user contexts from real world scenarios.The quantitative metrics obtained from the test results were further used to enhance the agent’s design simplicity, spontantanity, and alignment of the conversation with respect to real life situations. Designing an Alexa skill for the in-car voice assistant, conducting user testing in immersive environments and evaluating user's trust for the assistant based on its gender are the future milestones for this research project.
