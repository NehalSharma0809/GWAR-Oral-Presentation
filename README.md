# Crafting an Engaging User Experience for an In-Car Voice Assistant: A Design Thinking Approach

Abstract
Voice interfaces have become increasingly common and are extensively used in smartphone assistants(like Siri and Cortana), and home devices(like Amazon Echo and
Google Home). Considering the rapid advancements in the automobile industry and the popularity of conversational assistants, the presence of an in-car voice assistant can play a pivotal role in shaping consumer behaviour, enhancing brand recognition, and improving
driving experience in cars.The driverâ€™s eyes and hands are occupied while driving, therefore,
digital interactions like navigating directions and receiving calls, can be best accomplished by
voice.Recognizing these use cases makes the concept of an in-car voice assistant a new domain
which can be explored to deliver richer and safer driving experiences.
